# CL-CSOUND

Csound7 Binding Library for Common Lisp


## Description
This is a Csound7 binding library for Common Lisp. It is not compatible with Csound6. In addition to the basic API bindings, it also includes several features for real-time control. While it is currently in the initial phase, we plan to add more documentation and usage examples. While development is primarily focused on SBCL, the goal is to ensure it works on all implementations.


## Requirement
- Csound7(https://github.com/csound/csound)
